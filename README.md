## Description
- We can do two transactions using this ATM app.
- One is deposit and the other one is withdraw.
- Any non-negative amount can be deposited by choosing a deposit option from the select menu.
- Any non-negative amount which is less than the current balance amount can be withdrawn.
- Whenever a valid transaction(deposit / withdraw) happens the balance amount will be updated.
- Whenever the user enters negative amount / try to withdraw more than the balance / not choosing the options
  the user will be informed about what was wrong in their action.
